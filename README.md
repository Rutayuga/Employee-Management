# Employee Management
This repo is a learning playground for Java OOP â€” ideal for students or new developers to understand real-world object-oriented programming.
This project demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java, including:

- âœ… Inheritance  
- âœ… Method Overriding  
- âœ… Polymorphism  
- âœ… Class Structure and Refactoring  
- âœ… Practical Use of `extends` and `super`  

This is a Java-based Employee Management System designed to handle the essential operations of employee records, such as:

- Adding new employees
- Viewing employee details
- Updating employee information
- Deleting employee records

ðŸš€ Project Structure

| File              | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Main.java`       | Base class with fields and salary calculation logic          |
| `Employee.java`   | Subclass of Main (may include overrides or extensions)       |
| `PermEmployee.java` | Inherits from `Employee`, adds `doFun()` behavior          |

ðŸ”„ Polymorphism in Action

This project shows how **runtime polymorphism** works:

```java
Employee emp = new PermEmployee();
emp.calculateSalary(); // Calls the overridden method from PermEmployee (if overridden)
